# BankProject

This is to practice creating several immutable classes and different methods within these classes. I want to call on different classes and methods to perform the logic in each individual class. 

Account Class is a simple immutable class to create data for an account. 
* Name of the customer
* Name of the account
* Customer ID. 

TransactionData Class is an immutable class for the logic for 
* Check balance
* Depost
* Withdrawal
* Check last payment

InputLogic Class is a class for the inout logic
* Show customer name, account name, customer Id
* Prompt a menu with choices reflected in the TransactionData Class
* Switch statement with scanner to accept input from user through the terminal

Main Class
* Run the program
